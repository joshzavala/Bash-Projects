# Bash-Scripts
Hello and welcome to my bash scripts repo!
I run Manjaro KDE as my main Linux Distro so a majority of these scripts are specifically tailored to it.
Here are just a few.

- Start/Stop SSH - sshstart.sh sshstop.sh
- Restart Plasma KDE Environment - plasmarestart.sh 
- Install certain programs on Manjaro, Ubuntu, and CentOS - program_installer.sh
